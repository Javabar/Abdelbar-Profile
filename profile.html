    <h2>About me</h2>
     <p class="paragraphs"> 
        I am a highly ambitious individual with a positive attitude and a dedicated personality. I work hard in order to achieve my objectives and constantly meet deadlines.
        <br>My previous work experience and employment has taught me to work well in a group or in individual tasks. I am always willing to take on new tasks and benefit from every opportunity, as well as being self motivated to succeed. I believe my biggest strength is my ability to adapt to different types of work and environments, and given a chance I can bring in these qualities and skills to any organisation.
